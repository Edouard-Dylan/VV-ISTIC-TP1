# Practical Session #1: Introduction

1. Find in news sources a general public article reporting the discovery of a software bug. Describe the bug. If possible, say whether the bug is local or global and describe the failure that manifested its presence. Explain the repercussions of the bug for clients/consumers and the company or entity behind the faulty program. Speculate whether, in your opinion, testing the right scenario would have helped to discover the fault.

2. Apache Commons projects are known for the quality of their code and development practices. They use dedicated issue tracking systems to discuss and follow the evolution of bugs and new features. The following link https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/COLLECTIONS/issues/COLLECTIONS-794?filter=doneissues points to the issues considered as solved for the Apache Commons Collections project. Among those issues find one that corresponds to a bug that has been solved. Classify the bug as local or global. Explain the bug and the solution. Did the contributors of the project add new tests to ensure that the bug is detected if it reappears in the future?

3. Netflix is famous, among other things we love, for the popularization of *Chaos Engineering*, a fault-tolerance verification technique. The company has implemented protocols to test their entire system in production by simulating faults such as a server shutdown. During these experiments they evaluate the system's capabilities of delivering content under different conditions. The technique was described in [a paper](https://arxiv.org/ftp/arxiv/papers/1702/1702.05843.pdf) published in 2016. Read the paper and briefly explain what are the concrete experiments they perform, what are the requirements for these experiments, what are the variables they observe and what are the main results they obtained. Is Netflix the only company performing these experiments? Speculate how these experiments could be carried in other organizations in terms of the kind of experiment that could be performed and the system variables to observe during the experiments.

4. [WebAssembly](https://webassembly.org/) has become the fourth official language supported by web browsers. The language was born from a joint effort of the major players in the Web. Its creators presented their design decisions and the formal specification in [a scientific paper](https://people.mpi-sws.org/~rossberg/papers/Haas,%20Rossberg,%20Schuff,%20Titzer,%20Gohman,%20Wagner,%20Zakai,%20Bastien,%20Holman%20-%20Bringing%20the%20Web%20up%20to%20Speed%20with%20WebAssembly.pdf) published in 2018. The goal of the language is to be a low level, safe and portable compilation target for the Web and other embedding environments. The authors say that it is the first industrial strength language designed with formal semantics from the start. This evidences the feasibility of constructive approaches in this area. Read the paper and explain what are the main advantages of having a formal specification for WebAssembly. In your opinion, does this mean that WebAssembly implementations should not be tested? 

5.  Shortly after the appearance of WebAssembly another paper proposed a mechanized specification of the language using Isabelle. The paper can be consulted here: https://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/~caw77/papers/mechanising-and-verifying-the-webassembly-specification.pdf. This mechanized specification complements the first formalization attempt from the paper. According to the author of this second paper, what are the main advantages of the mechanized specification? Did it help improving the original formal specification of the language? What other artifacts were derived from this mechanized specification? How did the author verify the specification? Does this new specification removes the need for testing?

## Answers
1. I found a bug on Tiktok app that append in July 2021. TikTok users have been re-encountering a strange bug that resets their follower count all the way back down to zero. It seems like it's a local bug, there is no inpact on others components and it don't affect the global structure of the software. The bug appears when the follower count falls to 0. There was global panic among application users and numerous complaints about Tiktok.
Link to the [article](https://www.dexerto.com/entertainment/tiktok-0-followers-glitch-fix-for-account-bug-as-profiles-show-no-followers-1566312/).

2. Link to the [bug](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/COLLECTIONS/issues/COLLECTIONS-799?filter=doneissues). The bug i a local bug but with major consequencies. Functions pollFirst() and pollLast() are successfully executed and do not throw an UnsupportedOperationException on an UnmodifiableNavigableSet instance. It was detected during testing with assertj. No others tests was implemented (unspecified).

3. They experimented with these bugs:
   - terminate virtual machine instances
   - inject latency into requests between services
   - fail requests between services
   - fail an internal service
   - make an entire Amazon region unavailable
They observed some metric and essentialy the stream starts per second (SPS) metric. They define somes equirements for experiments like clear definition of steady state (measurable), precise assumptions about system behavior in control and experimental groups, appropriate selection of variables reflecting real events. As result, they obtain some data and variations on metrics. Netflix isn't the only compagny that experiments chaos engineering, Amazon, Google, Microsoft and Facebook do it too. As Netflix, it's possible to implement chaos engineering in organizations. We can inject latences in internal network, shuting down some serveurs (if their is multiple of them),etc. Before doing this, it's essential to defined the expected behavior and expected results.

4. The main advantages of having a formal specification for WebAssembly are Safety, Fast low-level code, portability, compact code. The specification is important but that doesn't mean we don't need to test it. Even if it's great explaned, some tests have to be implemented.
